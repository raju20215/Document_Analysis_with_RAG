## 📧 For Cover Letters

### Opening Paragraph Template:
```
In my recent project, DocGenius, I tackled the challenge of enabling fast, 
intelligent document search while maintaining complete data privacy. By implementing 
a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system with LangChain and Ollama, I created 
a solution that processes queries in under 3 seconds while keeping all data local—
addressing a critical need for organizations handling sensitive documents. This 
experience strengthened my expertise in AI/ML engineering, particularly in building 
production-ready LLM applications.
```

### Project Deep-Dive Template:
```
My most challenging project, DocGenius, required solving multiple technical problems 
simultaneously: efficient vector search across large document collections, accurate 
LLM response generation without hallucinations, and an intuitive user interface. 

I architected a RAG pipeline using FAISS for similarity search, nomic-embed-text for 
embeddings, and Gemma3:1b for answer generation. The key innovation was optimizing 
chunk size (1000 chars with 200 overlap) to balance context preservation and 
retrieval accuracy, ultimately achieving <100ms search latency.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with cutting-edge AI technologies while 
maintaining focus on practical constraints like privacy, performance, and user 
experience—skills directly applicable to [target role].
